<h2>ReactJs Recruitment Task</h2>

The attache images are how the pages look like on browser.

<ol>
<li>React Router</li>
<li>Form Validation</li>
<li>JS functionalities</li>
</ul>

I have used js files to create json code to use on the pages.

Thus, comments will be updated on the browser and displayed when added, however when reloaded the page, it will not retain the new comments.
